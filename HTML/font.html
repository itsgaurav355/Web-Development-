    <h1>The Night King </h1>
 
    <p>History. According to legend, Night's King lived during the Age of Heroes, not long after the Wall was complete. While serving as the thirteenth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, he fell in love with a white-skinned woman, and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well.</p>

    <p>At this time thousands of years ago, the Children of the Forest were at war with the First Men. They were losing, and needed a secret weapon, so Leaf plunged a dragonglass dagger into a man's chest, causing his eyes to turn blue and turning him into the first White Walker. And so the Night King was born.</p>
